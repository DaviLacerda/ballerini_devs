* Challenged by Rafaella Ballerini in his Discord and Instagram, i needed create this based in this figma project using React. This is awesome, because is a project like in real developer life. I liked to much to development this, and for shure i'll try to better this project, principally in UX/UI, and Clean Code ( with my reading of Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship ). If you like my project, give a star above. And if you read my code and have a suggest, take a pull request for me! Thanks, i'll see you in my others projects.. ðŸ‘‹
